<img src="../recipes/images/download.jpeg">

<h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Com tam is a Vietnamese dish made from rice with fractured rice grains. It refers to the broken rice grains, while cơm refers to cooked rice. Although there are varied names like cơm tấm Sài Gòn (Saigon-style broken rice), particularly for Saigon, the main ingredients remain the same for most cases.</p>
                <p>In its early days, Com Tam was a popular dish among poor rice farmers in the Mekong Delta due to their economic circumstances. During bad rice seasons, these people didn't have enough good rice to sell, so they used broken rice to cook. Broken rice is fragments of rice grains broken during the handling processes and was regarded as inferior rice at the time.Broken rice was used solely because it was readily available in the farmers' houses and could fill their stomachs for a long time.[</p>
