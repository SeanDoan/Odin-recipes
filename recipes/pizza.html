            <ul>
                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</p>
                <li>Step 2</li>
                    <p>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
                <li>Step 3</li>
                    <p>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
                <li>Step4</li>
                    <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</p>
                <li>Step 5</li>
                    <p>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>
                <li>Step 6</li>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
